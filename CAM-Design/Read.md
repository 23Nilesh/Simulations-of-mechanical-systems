# CAM-design
>The cam and follower mechanism is widely used for operating the inlet and exhaust valves of internal combustion engines.

## My Contribution:-
>1. Used Matlab to build rise and fall equations of cam to analyze what kind of a profile will give minimum jerk.
>
>2. The time of fall should equal to the time of rise so that alternatively, one can be used for inlet and other for the outlet of exhaust in engines.
